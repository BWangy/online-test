# Online Test

This project implements a data manager for an online test system written in Java that represents the model component of the Model View Controller design pattern. It allows the user to create an online test containing true/false questions, multiple choice questions, and fill in the blank questions. It also provides functionality for grading exams and returning statistics for each exam, such as the average score of the students taking an exam.
